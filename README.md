# Sass, Gulp, Sourcemaps and Autoprefixer

If you are new to Sass, or even an experienced user, getting up to speed with the latest tools and configurations can be a real challenge. Clearly one of the biggest differences between the original Ruby version of Sass and Libsass is setting up the processor. Ruby Sass came with this built in, and used with Rails the Rails Asset Pipeline also addressed most of those needs. In today's JavaScript asset build systems, there are many more choices, between Gulp, Grunt, Broccoli and others, what are you to focus on? How do you configure them? How do you simply get started?

While there is a lot to learn, you don't need to learn the whole API in order to get up and running with most of the common power tools. Setting up Libsass with Gulp and integrating Sourcemaps with Autoprefixer for a real powerhouse of utilities is actually a pretty simple process.
